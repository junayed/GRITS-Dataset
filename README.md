# GRITS-Dataset
Retrofitting and thermographic survey (TS) companies in Scotland collaborate with social housing providers to tackle fuel poverty. They employ ground-level infrared (IR) camera-based-TSs (GIRTSs) for collecting thermal images to identi-fy the heat loss sources resulting from poor insulation. However, this identifica-tion process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, necessitating extensive data processing. To automate this, an AI-driven approach is necessary. 

To do that, and build the industry grade software prototype, we developed a dataset with GRITS and performed our experiments. 

This data was collected and annotated with the help of the experts from IRT Surveys and National Subsea Centre, Scotland.
